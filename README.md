## MRI Tumor Detector (PyTorch)

This repository aims to build a deep learning-based MRI tumor detection model using PyTorch. The goal was to develop
an AI-powered system that can assist in detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans.

The dataset used in this project consists of MRI brain scans with labeled tumor regions.
Folder named "yes" consists of MRI scans with brain tumor and folder named "no" without.
